## **Installation**

To set up the **Online Voting System** on your local machine or server, follow the steps below:

### **1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-voting-system.git
cd online-voting-system
```

### **2. Set up the Database:**

- Create a new MySQL database. For example, name it `voting_system`.
- Import the provided SQL file (`database.sql`) to create tables for users, elections, candidates, and votes.

```sql
-- database.sql
CREATE DATABASE voting_system;

USE voting_system;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE elections (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  start_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
  end_date DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE candidates (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  election_id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  party VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (election_id) REFERENCES elections(id)
);

CREATE TABLE votes (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  candidate_id INT NOT NULL,
  election_id INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (candidate_id) REFERENCES candidates(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (election_id) REFERENCES elections(id)
);
```

### **3. Configure the Database Connection:**

Update the database connection credentials in `includes/db.php`:

```php
<?php
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "voting_system");
if (!$conn) {
  die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>
```

### **4. Setup Admin Account:**
To access the admin panel, you need to create an admin user manually in the `users` table. You can do this by running the following SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (email, password, is_admin) VALUES ('admin@example.com', 'yourpassword', 1);
```

> **Note**: Ensure the password is hashed in a real-world implementation for security.

## **Usage**

### **User Flow:**

   - After successful login, the user is redirected to the election page.

   - Users can view the list of candidates for each active election.
   - After viewing the candidates, users can cast their vote (one vote per election).
   
3. **Logout**:

### **Admin Flow:**

1. **Login to Admin Panel**:
   - The admin signs in using their credentials and is directed to the admin dashboard.
